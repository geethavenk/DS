# Applied data science capstone project

This is a capstone project as part of "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization". 

## Introduction

In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Objective

- To apply data science toolkit to study how different variables such as payload mass, launch site and orbits affect the sucess of the first stage landing.
- To determine which algorithm predicts the successfull landing of the first stage with high accuracy.

## Methodology

### 1. Data collection

- Using SpaceX Rest API
- Using webscraping 

### 2. Data wrangling

- Filtering the data
- Dealing with missing values
- Preparing the data using hot encoding

### 3. Exploratory data analysis using SQL and visualization

### 4. Ineteractive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash

### 5. Predictive analysis using classification algorithms
